- Hello World!
- I'm SidKay.
- I am an aspiring programmer who is mainly learning C++ and Python. But I also know a little bit of other programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Java and C#.
- I'm also a university student who is studying Computer Science. School sucks btw.
- I aim to use this platform to keep some programming-based assignments I do, and maybe any kind of personal programming project that I happen to do someday.
- I'm really looking forward to creating something... good. I guess...
